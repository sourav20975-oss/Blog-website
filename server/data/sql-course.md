## Installing MySQL

### What is MySQL workbench?

MySQL Workbench is a visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. It provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more.

### What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and management of data in databases. If you know one DBMS, you can easily transition to another, as they share similar concepts and functionalities.

### Windows / macOS Installation

1.  Download from: [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
2.  Run the installer and choose **Developer Default**.
3.  Set a root password when prompted.
4.  Install MySQL Workbench (optional but helpful GUI).

### Linux (Ubuntu) Installation

Follow these steps to install MySQL and create a user:

* * *

#### Step 1: Update Package Index

```bash
sudo apt update
```

* * *

#### Step 2: Install MySQL Server

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

* * *

#### Step 3: Secure the Installation

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Choose your options (yes to most).

* * *

#### Step 4: Create a User `'sourav'@'localhost'`

Log into MySQL:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

Run the following SQL commands:

```sql
CREATE USER 'sourav'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sourav'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

* * *

#### Step 5: Test Login

```bash
mysql -u sourav -p
```

Enter the password: `password`

Make sure to replace `'password'` with a secure password of your choice in production environments.

## Getting Started with MySQL

### What is a Database?

A **database** is a container that stores related data in an organized way. In MySQL, a database holds one or more **tables**.

Think of it like:

-   **Folder analogy**:
    
    -   A **database** is like a folder.
    -   Each **table** is a file inside that folder.
    -   The **rows** in the table are like the content inside each file.
-   **Excel analogy**:
    
    -   A **database** is like an Excel workbook.
    -   Each **table** is a separate sheet inside that workbook.
    -   Each **row** in the table is like a row in Excel.

* * *

### Step 1: Create a Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE startersql;
```

After creating the database, either:

-   Right-click it in MySQL Workbench and select **"Set as Default Schema"**, or
-   Use this SQL command:

```sql
USE startersql;
```

* * *

### Step 2: Create a Table

Now we’ll create a simple `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other'),
    date_of_birth DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

This table will store basic user info.

* * *

### Step 3: Drop the Database

You can delete the entire database (and all its tables) using:

```sql
DROP DATABASE startersql;
```

> Be careful — this will delete everything in that database.

* * *

#### Data Types Explained

-   `INT`: Integer type, used for whole numbers.
-   `VARCHAR(100)`: Variable-length string, up to 100 characters.
-   `ENUM`: A string object with a value chosen from a list of permitted values. eg. `gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other')`
-   `DATE`: Stores date values. eg `date_of_birth DATE`
-   `TIMESTAMP`: Stores date and time, automatically set to the current timestamp when a row is created.
-   `BOOLEAN`: Stores TRUE or FALSE values, often used for flags like `is_active`.
-   `DECIMAL(10, 2)`: Stores exact numeric data values, useful for financial data. The first number is the total number of digits, and the second is the number of digits after the decimal point.

* * *

#### Constraints Explained

-   `AUTO_INCREMENT`: Automatically generates a unique number for each row.
-   `PRIMARY KEY`: Uniquely identifies each row in the table.
-   `NOT NULL`: Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value.
-   `UNIQUE`: Ensures all values in a column are different.
-   `DEFAULT`: Sets a default value for a column if no value is provided. eg. `created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE`

* * *

## Working with Tables in MySQL

### Selecting Data from a Table

#### Select All Columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This fetches every column and every row from the `users` table.

#### Select Specific Columns

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users;
```

This only fetches the `name` and `email` columns from all rows.

* * *

### Renaming a Table

To rename an existing table:

```sql
RENAME TABLE users TO customers;
```

To rename it back:

```sql
RENAME TABLE customers TO users;
```

* * *

### Altering a Table

You can use `ALTER TABLE` to modify an existing table.

#### Add a Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
```

#### Drop a Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN is_active;
```

#### Modify a Column Type

```sql
ALTER TABLE users MODIFY COLUMN name VARCHAR(150);
```

* * *

### Move a Column to the First Position

To move a column (e.g., `email`) to the first position:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users MODIFY COLUMN email VARCHAR(100) FIRST;
```

To move a column after another column (e.g., move `gender` after `name`):

```sql
ALTER TABLE users MODIFY COLUMN gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other') AFTER name;
```

## Inserting Data into MySQL Tables

To add data into a table, we use the `INSERT INTO` statement.

* * *

### Insert Without Specifying Column Names (Full Row Insert)

This method **requires** you to provide values for **all columns in order**, except columns with default values or `AUTO_INCREMENT`.

```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES
(1, 'Alice', '[email protected]', 'Female', '1995-05-14', DEFAULT);
```

> Not recommended if your table structure might change (e.g., new columns added later).

* * *

### Insert by Specifying Column Names (Best Practice)

This method is safer and more readable. You only insert into specific columns.

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, gender, date_of_birth) VALUES
('Bob', '[email protected]', 'Male', '1990-11-23');
```

or for multiple rows:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, gender, date_of_birth) VALUES
('Bob', '[email protected]', 'Male', '1990-11-23'),
('Charlie', '[email protected]', 'Other', '1988-02-17');
```

The remaining columns like `id` (which is `AUTO_INCREMENT`) and `created_at` (which has a default) are automatically handled by MySQL.

* * *

### Insert Multiple Rows at Once

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, gender, date_of_birth) VALUES
('Charlie', '[email protected]', 'Other', '1988-02-17'),
('David', '[email protected]', 'Male', '2000-08-09'),
('Eva', '[email protected]', 'Female', '1993-12-30');
```

This is more efficient than inserting rows one by one.

* * *

## Querying Data in MySQL using `SELECT`

The `SELECT` statement is used to query data from a table.

* * *

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

To select all columns:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

* * *

### Filtering Rows with `WHERE`

#### Equal To

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = 'Male';
```

#### Not Equal To

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender != 'Female';
-- or
SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender <> 'Female';
```

#### Greater Than / Less Than

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE date_of_birth < '1995-01-01';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 10;
```

#### Greater Than or Equal / Less Than or Equal

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id >= 5;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id <= 20;
```

* * *

### Working with NULL

#### IS NULL

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE date_of_birth IS NULL;
```

#### IS NOT NULL

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL;
```

* * *

### BETWEEN

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '2000-12-31';
```

* * *

### IN

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender IN ('Male', 'Other');
```

* * *

### LIKE (Pattern Matching)

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'A%';  -- Starts with A
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%a';  -- Ends with a
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%li%'; -- Contains 'li'
```

* * *

### AND / OR

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = 'Female' AND date_of_birth > '1990-01-01';
 
SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = 'Male' OR gender = 'Other';
```

* * *

### ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY date_of_birth ASC;
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name DESC;
```

* * *

### LIMIT

```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;  -- Top 5 rows
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;  -- Skip first 5 rows, then get next 10
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5, 10;  -- Get 10 rows starting from the 6th row (Same as above)
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Quick Quiz

What does the following queries do?

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE salary > 60000 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000;
```

## UPDATE - Modifying Existing Data

The `UPDATE` statement is used to change values in one or more rows.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

### Example: Update One Column

```sql
UPDATE users
SET name = 'Alicia'
WHERE id = 1;
```

This changes the name of the user with `id = 1` to "Alicia".

### Example: Update Multiple Columns

```sql
UPDATE users
SET name = 'Robert', email = '[email protected]'
WHERE id = 2;
```

### Without WHERE Clause (Warning)

```sql
UPDATE users
SET gender = 'Other';
```

> This updates **every row** in the table. Be very careful when omitting the `WHERE` clause.

* * *

### Quick Quiz: Practice Your `UPDATE` Skills

Try answering or running these queries based on your `users` table.

#### 1\. Update the salary of user with `id = 5` to ₹70,000.

```sql
UPDATE users
SET salary = 70000
WHERE id = 5;
```

* * *

#### 2\. Change the name of the user with email `[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` to `Aisha Khan`.

```sql
UPDATE users
SET name = 'Aisha Khan'
WHERE email = '[email protected]';
```

* * *

#### 3\. Increase salary by ₹10,000 for all users whose salary is less than ₹60,000.

```sql
UPDATE users
SET salary = salary + 10000
WHERE salary < 60000;
```

* * *

#### 4\. Set the gender of user `Ishaan` to `Other`.

```sql
UPDATE users
SET gender = 'Other'
WHERE name = 'Ishaan';
```

* * *

#### 5\. Reset salary of all users to ₹50,000 (Careful - affects all rows).

```sql
UPDATE users
SET salary = 50000;
```

> Note: This query will overwrite salary for **every** user. Use with caution!

## DELETE - Removing Data from a Table

The `DELETE` statement removes rows from a table.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Example: Delete One Row

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 3;
```

### Delete Multiple Rows

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE gender = 'Other';
```

### Delete All Rows (but keep table structure)

```sql
DELETE FROM users;
```

### Drop the Entire Table (use with caution)

```sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

> This removes the table structure **and all data** permanently.

* * *

### Best Practices

-   Always use `WHERE` unless you're intentionally updating/deleting everything.
-   Consider running a `SELECT` with the same `WHERE` clause first to confirm what will be affected:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 3;
```

-   Always back up important data before performing destructive operations.

### Quick Quiz: Practice Your `DELETE` Skills

what will happen if you run these queries?

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE salary < 50000;
```

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE salary IS NULL;
```

## MySQL Constraints

Constraints in MySQL are rules applied to table columns to ensure the **accuracy**, **validity**, and **integrity** of the data.

* * *

### 1\. `UNIQUE` Constraint

Ensures that all values in a column are **different**.

#### Example (during table creation):

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

#### Add `UNIQUE` using `ALTER TABLE`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);
```

* * *

### 2\. `NOT NULL` Constraint

Ensures that a column **cannot contain NULL** values.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

#### Change an existing column to NOT NULL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
MODIFY COLUMN name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;
```

#### Make a column nullable again:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
MODIFY COLUMN name VARCHAR(100) NULL;
```

* * *

### 3\. `CHECK` Constraint

Ensures that values in a column satisfy a **specific condition**.

#### Example: Allow only dates of birth after Jan 1, 2000

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_dob CHECK (date_of_birth > '2000-01-01');
```

Naming the constraint (`chk_dob`) helps if you want to drop it later.

* * *

### 4\. `DEFAULT` Constraint

Sets a **default value** for a column if none is provided during insert.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

#### Add DEFAULT using `ALTER TABLE`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ALTER COLUMN is_active SET DEFAULT TRUE;
```

* * *

### 5\. `PRIMARY KEY` Constraint

Uniquely identifies each row. Must be **NOT NULL** and **UNIQUE**.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

#### Add later with `ALTER TABLE`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
```

* * *

### 6\. `AUTO_INCREMENT`

Used with `PRIMARY KEY` to automatically assign the next number.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

Each new row gets the next available integer value in `id`.

* * *

### Summary Table

| Constraint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `UNIQUE` | Prevents duplicate values |
| `NOT NULL` | Ensures value is not NULL |
| `CHECK` | Restricts values using a condition |
| `DEFAULT` | Sets a default value |
| `PRIMARY KEY` | Uniquely identifies each row |
| `AUTO_INCREMENT` | Automatically generates unique numbers |

## SQL Functions (MySQL)

SQL functions help you **analyze**, **transform**, or **summarize** data in your tables.

We'll use the `users` table which includes:

-   `id`, `name`, `email`, `gender`, `date_of_birth`, `salary`, `created_at`

* * *

### 1\. Aggregate Functions

These return a **single value** from a set of rows.

#### `COUNT()`

Count total number of users:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

Count users who are Female:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE gender = 'Female';
```

* * *

#### `MIN()` and `MAX()`

Get the minimum and maximum salary:

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM users;
```

* * *

#### `SUM()`

Calculate total salary payout:

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_payroll FROM users;
```

* * *

#### `AVG()`

Find average salary:

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM users;
```

* * *

#### Grouping with `GROUP BY`

Average salary by gender:

```sql
SELECT gender, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM users
GROUP BY gender;
```

* * *

### 2\. String Functions

#### `LENGTH()`

Length of user names:

```sql
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) AS name_length FROM users;
```

* * *

#### `LOWER()` and `UPPER()`

Convert names to lowercase or uppercase:

```sql
SELECT name, LOWER(name) AS lowercase_name FROM users;
SELECT name, UPPER(name) AS uppercase_name FROM users;
```

* * *

#### `CONCAT()`

Combine name and email:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(name, ' <', email, '>') AS user_contact FROM users;
```

* * *

### 3\. Date Functions

#### `NOW()`

Current date and time:

```sql
SELECT NOW();
```

* * *

#### `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()`

Extract parts of `date_of_birth`:

```sql
SELECT name, YEAR(date_of_birth) AS birth_year FROM users;
```

* * *

#### `DATEDIFF()`

Find number of days between today and birthdate:

```sql
SELECT name, DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), date_of_birth) AS days_lived FROM users;
```

* * *

#### `TIMESTAMPDIFF()`

Calculate age in years:

```sql
SELECT name, TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, date_of_birth, CURDATE()) AS age FROM users;
```

* * *

### 4\. Mathematical Functions

#### `ROUND()`, `FLOOR()`, `CEIL()`

```sql
SELECT salary,
       ROUND(salary) AS rounded,
       FLOOR(salary) AS floored,
       CEIL(salary) AS ceiled
FROM users;
```

* * *

#### `MOD()`

Find even or odd user IDs:

```sql
SELECT id, MOD(id, 2) AS remainder FROM users;
```

* * *

### 5\. Conditional Functions

#### `IF()`

```sql
SELECT name, gender,
       IF(gender = 'Female', 'Yes', 'No') AS is_female
FROM users;
```

* * *

### Summary Table

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `COUNT()` | Count rows |
| `SUM()` | Total of a column |
| `AVG()` | Average of values |
| `MIN()`/`MAX()` | Lowest / highest value |
| `LENGTH()` | String length |
| `CONCAT()` | Merge strings |
| `YEAR()`/`DATEDIFF()` | Date breakdown / age |
| `ROUND()` | Rounding numbers |
| `IF()` | Conditional logic |

## MySQL Transactions and AutoCommit

By default, MySQL operates in **AutoCommit** mode. This means that every SQL statement is treated as a **transaction** and is committed automatically. However, for more control over when changes are saved, you can turn **AutoCommit** off and manage transactions manually.

* * *

### 1\. Disabling AutoCommit

When **AutoCommit** is off, you can explicitly control when to commit or rollback changes.

#### To disable AutoCommit:

```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
```

This turns off AutoCommit, meaning that changes you make won't be saved to the database unless you explicitly tell MySQL to commit them.

> **Important**: Until you execute a `COMMIT`, your changes are not permanent.

* * *

### 2\. COMMIT — Save Changes to the Database

Once you’ve made changes and you’re confident that everything is correct, you can use the `COMMIT` command to save those changes.

#### To commit a transaction:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

This saves all the changes made since the last `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`. After this point, the changes become permanent.

* * *

### 3\. ROLLBACK — Revert Changes to the Last Safe Point

If you make an error or decide you don't want to save your changes, you can **rollback** the transaction to its previous state.

#### To rollback a transaction:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

This undoes all changes since the last `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.

* * *

#### Example Workflow

Here’s a simple example of using `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` in a transaction:

1.  Turn off AutoCommit:
    
    ```sql
    SET autocommit = 0;
    ```
    
2.  Make some changes (e.g., updating a salary):
    
    ```sql
    UPDATE users SET salary = 80000 WHERE id = 5;
    ```
    
3.  Decide whether to commit or rollback:
    
    -   If you’re happy with the changes, run:
        
        ```sql
        COMMIT;
        ```
        
    -   If you’re not happy and want to revert the changes, run:
        
        ```sql
        ROLLBACK;
        ```
        

* * *

### 4\. Enabling AutoCommit Again

If you want to turn AutoCommit back on (so that every statement is automatically committed), you can do so with:

```sql
SET autocommit = 1;
```

* * *

### Best Practices

-   **Use `COMMIT`** when you want to make changes permanent.
    
-   **Use `ROLLBACK`** to discard changes if something goes wrong.
    
-   Consider **disabling AutoCommit** when performing complex updates to avoid saving partial or incorrect data.
    

## Understanding `PRIMARY KEY` in MySQL

A `PRIMARY KEY` is a constraint in SQL that **uniquely identifies each row** in a table. It is one of the most important concepts in database design.

* * *

### What is a Primary Key?

-   A `PRIMARY KEY`:
    
    -   Must be **unique**
    -   Cannot be **NULL**
    -   Is used to identify rows in a table
    -   Can be a single column or a combination of columns
    -   Each table can have **only one** primary key

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

* * *

### How Is `PRIMARY KEY` Different from `UNIQUE`?

At first glance, `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` might seem similar since both prevent duplicate values. But there are important differences:

| Feature | `PRIMARY KEY` | `UNIQUE` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Must be unique | Yes | Yes |
| Allows NULL values | No | Yes (one or more NULLs allowed) |
| How many allowed | Only one per table | Can have multiple |
| Required by table | Recommended, often required | Optional |
| Dropping | Cannot be easily dropped | Can be dropped anytime |

* * *

### Example with UNIQUE

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In this example:

-   `id` is the unique identifier for each row.
-   `email` must be unique, but is not the primary key.

* * *

### Can I Drop a PRIMARY KEY?

Yes, but it is more restricted than dropping a `UNIQUE` constraint.

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP PRIMARY KEY;
```

> This may fail if the primary key is being used elsewhere (like in a foreign key or auto\_increment column).

To drop a `UNIQUE` constraint:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP INDEX email;
```

### Auto Increment

In MySQL, a `PRIMARY KEY` is often used with the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute to automatically generate unique values for new rows.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

This means that every time you insert a new row, MySQL will automatically assign a unique value to the `id` column. You can change the starting value of `AUTO_INCREMENT` using:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users AUTO_INCREMENT = 1000;
```

* * *

### Key Takeaways

-   Use `PRIMARY KEY` for the **main identifier** of a row.
    
-   Use `UNIQUE` for enforcing **non-duplicate values** in other columns (like email or phone).
    
-   You can have **only one primary key**, but you can have **many unique constraints**.
    

## Foreign Keys in MySQL

A **foreign key** is a column that creates a **link between two tables**. It ensures that the value in one table **must match** a value in another table.

This is used to maintain **data integrity** between related data.

* * *

### Why Use Foreign Keys?

Imagine this scenario:

You have a `users` table. Now you want to store each user's address. Instead of putting address columns inside the `users` table, you create a separate `addresses` table, and link it to `users` using a **foreign key**.

* * *

### Creating a Table with a Foreign Key

Let’s create an `addresses` table where each address belongs to a user.

```sql
CREATE TABLE addresses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    street VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(100),
    pincode VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

#### Explanation:

-   `user_id` is a **foreign key**.
-   It references the `id` column in the `users` table.
-   This ensures that every address must be linked to a valid user.

* * *

### Dropping a Foreign Key

To drop a foreign key, you need to know its **constraint name**. MySQL auto-generates it if you don’t specify one, or you can name it yourself:

```sql
CREATE TABLE addresses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

To drop it:

```sql
ALTER TABLE addresses
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_user;
```

* * *

### Adding a Foreign Key Later (Using ALTER)

Suppose the foreign key was **not defined during table creation**. You can add it later using `ALTER TABLE`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE addresses
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id);
```

* * *

### Adding `ON DELETE` Action

By default, if you delete a user that has related addresses, MySQL will throw an error. You can control this behavior with `ON DELETE`.

#### Example with `ON DELETE CASCADE`:

If you want addresses to be automatically deleted when the user is deleted:

```sql
CREATE TABLE addresses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    street VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(100),
    pincode VARCHAR(10),
    CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Or alter it later:

```sql
ALTER TABLE addresses
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

* * *

### Other ON DELETE Options

| ON DELETE Option | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `CASCADE` | Deletes all related rows in child table |
| `SET NULL` | Sets the foreign key to NULL in the child table |
| `RESTRICT` | Prevents deletion of parent if child exists (default) |

### Summary

-   Foreign keys **connect tables** and enforce **valid references**.
    
-   You can create them inline or with `ALTER TABLE`.
    
-   You can drop them by name.
    
-   Use `ON DELETE` to control what happens when the parent row is deleted.
    

## SQL JOINs in MySQL

In SQL, **JOINs** are used to combine rows from **two or more tables** based on related columns — usually a **foreign key** in one table referencing a **primary key** in another.

We’ll use the following two tables:

#### `users` table

| id | name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Aarav |
| 2 | Sneha |
| 3 | Raj |

#### `addresses` table

| id | user\_id | city |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | Mumbai |
| 2 | 2 | Kolkata |
| 3 | 4 | Delhi |

Note: `user_id` is a **foreign key** that references `users.id`.

* * *

### 1\. INNER JOIN

Returns **only the matching rows** from both tables.

```sql
SELECT users.name, addresses.city
FROM users
INNER JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```

#### Output:

| name | city |
| --- | --- |
| Aarav | Mumbai |
| Sneha | Kolkata |

> `Raj` is excluded because there is no matching address. `Delhi` is excluded because its `user_id` (4) is not in `users`.

#### Visual Representation:

```
users          addresses
 -----           ------
|  1  |         |  1  |
|  2  |         |  2  |
|     |         |     |
 => only matching pairs
```

* * *

### 2\. LEFT JOIN

Returns **all rows from the left table** (`users`), and matching rows from the right table (`addresses`). If no match is found, NULLs are returned.

```sql
SELECT users.name, addresses.city
FROM users
LEFT JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```

#### Output:

| name | city |
| --- | --- |
| Aarav | Mumbai |
| Sneha | Kolkata |
| Raj | NULL |

> `Raj` is shown even though he doesn’t have an address.

#### Visual Representation:

```
users          addresses
 -----           ------
|  1  |         |  1  |
|  2  |         |  2  |
|  3  |         |     |
 => all users + matched addresses (or NULL)
```

* * *

### 3\. RIGHT JOIN

Returns **all rows from the right table** (`addresses`), and matching rows from the left table (`users`). If no match is found, NULLs are returned.

```sql
SELECT users.name, addresses.city
FROM users
RIGHT JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```

#### Output:

| name | city |
| --- | --- |
| Aarav | Mumbai |
| Sneha | Kolkata |
| NULL | Delhi |

> `Delhi` is shown even though it points to a `user_id` that doesn't exist.

#### Visual Representation:

```
users          addresses
 -----           ------
|  1  |         |  1  |
|  2  |         |  2  |
|     |         |  4  |
 => all addresses + matched users (or NULL)
```

* * *

### Summary Table

| JOIN Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `INNER JOIN` | Only matching rows from both tables |
| `LEFT JOIN` | All rows from left table + matching from right |
| `RIGHT JOIN` | All rows from right table + matching from left |

## SQL `UNION` and `UNION ALL`

The `UNION` operator in SQL is used to **combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements**. It removes duplicates by default.

If you want to include all rows including duplicates, use `UNION ALL`.

* * *

### Example Scenario

You already have a `users` table for active users. Now, we’ll create an `admin_users` table to store users who are administrators or have special roles. We will then combine the names from both tables using `UNION`.

* * *

### Step 1: Create the `admin_users` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE admin_users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other'),
    date_of_birth DATE,
    salary INT
);
```

* * *

### Step 2: Insert Sample Data into `admin_users`

```sql
INSERT INTO admin_users (id, name, email, gender, date_of_birth, salary) VALUES
(101, 'Anil Kumar', '[email protected]', 'Male', '1985-04-12', 60000),
(102, 'Pooja Sharma', '[email protected]', 'Female', '1992-09-20', 58000),
(103, 'Rakesh Yadav', '[email protected]', 'Male', '1989-11-05', 54000),
(104, 'Fatima Begum', '[email protected]', 'Female', '1990-06-30', 62000);
```

* * *

### Step 3: Use `UNION` to Combine Data

Let’s combine the active and admin user names.

```sql
SELECT name FROM users
UNION
SELECT name FROM admin_users;
```

This returns a **single list of unique names** from both tables.

* * *

#### `UNION ALL` Example

If you want to keep duplicate names (if any), use `UNION ALL`.

```sql
SELECT name FROM users
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM admin_users;
```

* * *

### Using More Than One Column

You can also select multiple columns as long as both `SELECT` queries return the **same number of columns with compatible types**.

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM users
UNION
SELECT name, salary FROM admin_users;
```

* * *

### Adding separate roles

```sql
SELECT name, 'User' AS role FROM users
UNION
SELECT name, 'Admin' AS role FROM admin_users;
```

* * *

### Using Order By with `UNION`

```sql
SELECT name FROM users
UNION
SELECT name FROM admin_users
ORDER BY name;
```

* * *

### Rules of `UNION`

1.  The number of columns and their data types must match in all `SELECT` statements.
2.  `UNION` removes duplicates by default.
3.  `UNION ALL` keeps duplicates.

* * *

### When to Use `UNION`

-   When you have **two similar tables** (like current and archived data).
-   When you need to **combine filtered results** (e.g., high-salary users from two sources).
-   When performing **cross-category reporting**.

* * *

### Summary

| Operator | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `UNION` | Combines results, removes duplicates |
| `UNION ALL` | Combines results, keeps duplicates |

## Self JOIN in MySQL

A **Self JOIN** is a regular join, but the table is joined **with itself**.

This is useful when rows in the same table are related to each other. For example, when users refer other users, and we store the ID of the person who referred them in the same `users` table.

* * *

### Step 1: Add a `referred_by_id` Column

We’ll extend the existing `users` table to include a column called `referred_by_id`, which holds the `id` of the user who referred them.

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN referred_by_id INT;
```

This column:

-   Will be **NULL** for users who were not referred.
-   Will contain the **`id` of another user** who referred them.

* * *

### Step 2: Insert Referral Data (Optional)

Assuming `id = 1` is the first user, and referred others:

```sql
UPDATE users SET referred_by_id = 1 WHERE id IN (2, 3); -- User 1 referred Users 2 and 3
UPDATE users SET referred_by_id = 2 WHERE id = 4;       -- User 2 referred User 4
```

* * *

### Step 3: Use a Self JOIN to Get Referrer Names

We want to get each user’s name **along with the name of the person who referred them**.

```sql
SELECT 
  a.id,
  a.name AS user_name,
  b.name AS referred_by
FROM users a
LEFT JOIN users b ON a.referred_by_id = b.id;
```

#### Explanation:

-   `a` refers to the user being queried.
-   `b` refers to the user who referred them.
-   `LEFT JOIN` is used so that users with `NULL` in `referred_by_id` are also included.

* * *

#### Sample Output:

| id | user\_name | referred\_by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Aarav | NULL |
| 2 | Sneha | Aarav |
| 3 | Raj | Aarav |
| 4 | Fatima | Sneha |

* * *

### Summary

-   Use **Self JOIN** when you need to **join a table with itself**.
    
-   In referral-based relationships, store the referrer’s `id` in the same table.
    
-   Use aliases like `a` and `b` to differentiate the two instances of the same table.
    

## MySQL Views

A **view** in MySQL is a **virtual table** based on the result of a `SELECT` query. It does not store data itself — it always reflects the **current data** in the base tables.

Views are useful when:

-   You want to simplify complex queries
-   You want to reuse logic
-   You want to hide certain columns from users
-   You want a "live snapshot" of filtered data

* * *

### Creating a View

Suppose we want a view that lists all users earning more than ₹70,000.

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary_users AS
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM users
WHERE salary > 70000;
```

* * *

### Querying the View

```sql
SELECT * FROM high_salary_users;
```

This will return all users from the `users` table where salary is above ₹70,000.

* * *

### Demonstrating That a View is Always Up-To-Date

Let’s see what happens when the underlying data changes.

#### Step 1: View before update

```sql
SELECT * FROM high_salary_users;
```

Output:

| id | name | salary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Sneha | 75000 |
| 5 | Fatima | 80000 |

#### Step 2: Update a user's salary

```sql
UPDATE users
SET salary = 72000
WHERE name = 'Raj';
```

#### Step 3: Query the view again

```sql
SELECT * FROM high_salary_users;
```

New Output:

| id | name | salary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Sneha | 75000 |
| 5 | Fatima | 80000 |
| 3 | Raj | 72000 |

> Notice how **Raj** is now included in the view — without updating the view itself. That’s because views **always reflect live data** from the original table.

* * *

### Dropping a View

To remove a view:

```sql
DROP VIEW high_salary_users;
```

* * *

### Summary

-   Views act like **saved SELECT queries**
    
-   Views are **not duplicated data**
    
-   Changes to base tables are **reflected automatically**
    
-   Great for simplifying complex queries or creating filtered access
    

## MySQL Indexes

Indexes in MySQL are used to **speed up data retrieval**. They work like the index of a book — helping the database engine find rows faster, especially for **searches, filters, and joins**.

* * *

### Viewing Indexes on a Table

To see the indexes on a table, use:

```sql
SHOW INDEXES FROM users;
```

This shows all the indexes currently defined on the `users` table, including the automatically created **primary key** index.

* * *

### Creating a Single-Column Index

Suppose you're frequently searching users by their `email`. You can speed this up by indexing the `email` column.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);
```

#### What this does:

-   Creates an index named `idx_email`
-   Improves performance of queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '[email protected]';
```

* * *

### Important Notes

-   Indexes **consume extra disk space**
-   Indexes **slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`** operations slightly (because the index must be updated)
-   Use indexes **only when needed** (i.e., for columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`)

* * *

### Creating a Multi-Column Index

If you often query users using **both `gender` and `salary`**, a multi-column index is more efficient than separate indexes.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_gender_salary ON users(gender, salary);
```

#### Usage Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE gender = 'Female' AND salary > 70000;
```

This query can take advantage of the combined index on `gender` and `salary`.

* * *

### Index Order Matters

For a multi-column index on `(gender, salary)`:

-   This works efficiently:
    
    ```sql
    WHERE gender = 'Female' AND salary > 70000
    ```
    
-   But this **may not** use the index effectively:
    
    ```sql
    WHERE salary > 70000
    ```
    

Because the first column in the index (`gender`) is missing in the filter.

* * *

### Dropping an Index

To delete an index:

```sql
DROP INDEX idx_email ON users;
```

* * *

### Summary

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SHOW INDEXES` | View current indexes on a table |
| `CREATE INDEX` | Create single or multi-column indexes |
| `DROP INDEX` | Remove an index |
| **Use when** | Query performance on large tables is a concern |
| **Avoid on** | Columns that are rarely queried or always unique |

## Subqueries in MySQL

A **subquery** is a query nested inside another query. Subqueries are useful for breaking down complex problems into smaller parts.

They can be used in:

-   `SELECT` statements
-   `WHERE` clauses
-   `FROM` clauses

* * *

### Example Scenario: Salary Comparison

Suppose we want to find all users who **earn more than the average salary** of all users.

* * *

### Scalar Subquery Example

This subquery returns **a single value** — the average salary — and we compare each user's salary against it.

```sql
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM users
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM users
);
```

#### Explanation:

-   The inner query: `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM users` returns the average salary.
-   The outer query selects all users with a salary **greater than that average**.

* * *

### Subquery with `IN`

Now let's say we want to find users who have been referred by someone who earns more than ₹75,000.

```sql
SELECT id, name, referred_by_id
FROM users
WHERE referred_by_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM users WHERE salary > 75000
);
```

#### Explanation:

-   The inner query: `SELECT id FROM users WHERE salary > 75000` returns a list of user IDs (referrers) who earn more than ₹75,000.
-   The outer query selects users whose `referred_by_id` is in that list.

* * *

### Other Places Subqueries Are Used

You can also use subqueries:

-   Inside `SELECT` columns (called scalar subqueries)
-   In the `FROM` clause to create derived tables

Example in `SELECT`:

```sql
SELECT name, salary,
  (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM users) AS average_salary
FROM users;
```

This shows each user's salary along with the overall average.

* * *

### Summary

| Subquery Type | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| Scalar Subquery | Returns one value (e.g. AVG, MAX) |
| Subquery with `IN` | Returns multiple values |
| Subquery in `SELECT` | Shows related calculated value |
| Subquery in `FROM` | Acts as a virtual table |

Subqueries are powerful tools when filtering based on computed or dynamic conditions.

## GROUP BY and HAVING in MySQL

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to **group rows that have the same values** in specified columns. It is typically used with **aggregate functions** like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, or `MAX`.

The `HAVING` clause is used to **filter groups** after aggregation — similar to how `WHERE` filters individual rows.

* * *

### Example Table: `users`

Assume this is your `users` table:

| id | name | gender | salary | referred\_by\_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Aarav | Male | 80000 | NULL |
| 2 | Sneha | Female | 75000 | 1 |
| 3 | Raj | Male | 72000 | 1 |
| 4 | Fatima | Female | 85000 | 2 |
| 5 | Priya | Female | 70000 | NULL |

* * *

### GROUP BY Example: Average Salary by Gender

```sql
SELECT gender, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM users
GROUP BY gender;
```

#### Explanation:

-   This groups users by gender.
-   Then calculates the average salary for each group.

* * *

### GROUP BY with COUNT

Find how many users were referred by each user:

```sql
SELECT referred_by_id, COUNT(*) AS total_referred
FROM users
WHERE referred_by_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY referred_by_id;
```

#### Output:

| referred\_by\_id | total\_referred |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 1 |

* * *

### HAVING Clause: Filtering Groups

Let’s say we only want to show genders where the **average salary is greater than ₹75,000**.

```sql
SELECT gender, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM users
GROUP BY gender
HAVING AVG(salary) > 75000;
```

#### Why not `WHERE`?

-   `WHERE` is used **before** grouping.
-   `HAVING` is used **after** groups are formed — it's the only way to filter aggregated values.

* * *

### Another Example: Groups with More Than 1 Referral

```sql
SELECT referred_by_id, COUNT(*) AS total_referred
FROM users
WHERE referred_by_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY referred_by_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

* * *

### Summary

| Clause | Purpose | Can use aggregates? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WHERE` | Filters rows **before** grouping | No |
| `GROUP BY` | Groups rows based on column values | N/A |
| `HAVING` | Filters groups **after** aggregation | Yes |

Use `GROUP BY` to organize data, and `HAVING` to filter those groups based on aggregate conditions.

* * *

### ROLLUP

To get subtotals and grand totals, you can use `ROLLUP`:

```sql
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS total_users
FROM users
GROUP BY gender WITH ROLLUP;
```

#### Explanation:

-   This will give you a count of users by gender, along with a grand total for all users.

## Stored Procedures in MySQL

A **stored procedure** is a saved SQL block that can be executed later. It's useful when you want to encapsulate logic that can be reused multiple times — like queries, updates, or conditional operations.

* * *

### Why Change the Delimiter?

By default, MySQL uses `;` to end SQL statements.

But when defining stored procedures, we use `;` **inside** the procedure as well. This can confuse MySQL. To avoid this, we **temporarily change the delimiter** (e.g. to `$$` or `//`) while creating the procedure.

* * *

### Syntax for Creating a Stored Procedure

```sql
DELIMITER $$
 
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name()
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements go here
END$$
 
DELIMITER ;
```

After the procedure is created, we reset the delimiter back to `;`.

* * *

### Creating a Procedure with Input Parameters

Let’s say you want to create a stored procedure that inserts a new user into the `users` table.

#### Example:

```sql
DELIMITER $$
 
CREATE PROCEDURE AddUser(
    IN p_name VARCHAR(100),
    IN p_email VARCHAR(100),
    IN p_gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other'),
    IN p_dob DATE,
    IN p_salary INT
)
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO users (name, email, gender, date_of_birth, salary)
    VALUES (p_name, p_email, p_gender, p_dob, p_salary);
END$$
 
DELIMITER ;
```

This creates a procedure named `AddUser` that accepts five input parameters.

* * *

### Calling the Procedure

You can call the procedure using:

```sql
CALL AddUser('Kiran Sharma', '[email protected]', 'Female', '1994-06-15', 72000);
```

This will insert the new user into the `users` table.

* * *

### Notes

-   Input parameters are declared using the `IN` keyword.
-   Stored procedures are stored in the database and can be reused.

* * *

### Viewing Stored Procedures

```sql
SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db = 'startersql';
```

* * *

### Dropping a Stored Procedure

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS AddUser;
```

* * *

### Summary

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DELIMITER $$` | Temporarily change statement delimiter |
| `CREATE PROCEDURE` | Defines a new stored procedure |
| `CALL procedure_name(...)` | Executes a stored procedure |
| `DROP PROCEDURE` | Removes an existing procedure |

## Triggers in MySQL

A **trigger** is a special kind of stored program that is **automatically executed (triggered)** when a specific event occurs in a table — such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.

Triggers are commonly used for:

-   Logging changes
-   Enforcing additional business rules
-   Automatically updating related data

* * *

### Basic Trigger Structure

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
AFTER INSERT ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- statements to execute
END;
```

Triggers can be fired:

-   `BEFORE` or `AFTER` an event
-   On `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`

* * *

### Scenario: Log Every New User Insertion

Suppose we want to log every time a new user is inserted into the `users` table. We'll create a separate table called `user_log` to store log entries.

* * *

### Step 1: Create the Log Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_log (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    created_on TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

* * *

### Step 2: Create the Trigger

We now define a trigger that runs **after a new user is added**.

```sql
DELIMITER $$
 
CREATE TRIGGER after_user_insert
AFTER INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO user_log (user_id, name)
    VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.name);
END$$
 
DELIMITER ;
```

#### Explanation:

-   `AFTER INSERT` means the trigger fires after the user is inserted.
-   `NEW` refers to the new row being added to the `users` table.
-   We insert the new user's ID and name into the `user_log` table.

* * *

### Step 3: Test the Trigger

```sql
CALL AddUser('Ritika Jain', '[email protected]', 'Female', '1996-03-12', 74000);
```

Now check the `user_log` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_log;
```

You should see Ritika's info automatically logged.

* * *

### Dropping a Trigger

If you need to remove a trigger:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS after_user_insert;
```

* * *

### Summary

| Trigger Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `BEFORE` / `AFTER` | When the trigger runs |
| `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` | What kind of action triggers it |
| `NEW.column` | Refers to the new row (for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`) |
| `OLD.column` | Refers to the old row (for `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) |
| `FOR EACH ROW` | Executes for each affected row |

## More on MySQL

This section covers some essential MySQL features and operators that help you write more powerful and flexible queries.

* * *

### 1\. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AND` | All conditions must be true | `salary > 50000 AND gender = 'Male'` |
| `OR` | At least one condition is true | `gender = 'Male' OR gender = 'Other'` |
| `NOT` | Reverses a condition | `NOT gender = 'Female'` |

* * *

### 2\. Add a Column to an Existing Table

Use `ALTER TABLE` to add a column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN city VARCHAR(100);
```

This adds a new column named `city` to the `users` table.

* * *

### 3\. Wildcard Operators

Wildcards are used with the `LIKE` operator for pattern matching in text.

| Wildcard | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `%` | Matches any sequence | `WHERE name LIKE 'A%'` (starts with A) |
| `_` | Matches a single character | `WHERE name LIKE '_a%'` (second letter is 'a') |

* * *

### 4\. LIMIT with OFFSET

`LIMIT` is used to limit the number of rows returned. `OFFSET` skips a number of rows before starting to return rows.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
```

This skips the first 10 rows and returns the next 5.

Alternative syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10, 5;
```

This also skips 10 and returns 5 (syntax: `LIMIT offset, count`).

* * *

### 5\. DISTINCT Keyword

`DISTINCT` is used to return **only unique values**.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT gender FROM users;
```

Returns a list of unique gender values from the `users` table.

* * *

### 6\. TRUNCATE Keyword

`TRUNCATE` removes **all rows** from a table, but **keeps the table structure**.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE users;
```

-   Faster than `DELETE FROM users`
-   Cannot be rolled back (unless in a transaction-safe environment)

* * *

### 7\. CHANGE vs MODIFY Column

Both `CHANGE` and `MODIFY` are used to alter existing columns in a table, but they work slightly differently.

#### CHANGE: Rename and change datatype

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
CHANGE COLUMN city location VARCHAR(150);
```

This renames `city` to `location` and changes its type.

#### MODIFY: Only change datatype

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
MODIFY COLUMN salary BIGINT;
```

This changes only the datatype of `salary`.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered the essentials of SQL, including how to create and manage databases, tables, and records. With this knowledge, you can start building and querying your own databases effectively.
